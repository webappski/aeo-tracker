/**
 * Unified Visibility Index (UVI) — a single 0-100 score that combines four
 * signals from a run into one number, with transparent weights you can audit.
 *
 * Inspired by Rankability's "SPI" but open — no proprietary scoring,
 * everything is documented and verifiable from `_summary.json`.
 *
 *   UVI = w1·presence + w2·sentiment + w3·rank + w4·citation
 *
 * Default weights:
 *   - presence  35%   (% of cells where brand was mentioned)
 *   - sentiment 25%   (avg sentiment, 50 = neutral)
 *   - rank      20%   (avg position strength when listed)
 *   - citation  20%   (% of cells where brand appeared in a citation URL)
 *
 * Components without any underlying measurement return `null` (e.g. no cell
 * has a numeric `position` → rank is `null`, not 50) and are EXCLUDED from
 * the composite — remaining weights are re-normalised over the present
 * components only. This stops the report from inflating UVI with phantom
 * fallback values when a signal was never measured this run.
 *
 * Designed so each component is independently meaningful and the user can
 * spot which signal dragged the index down.

 *                                cells for sentiment).
 *   - weight                   — default (unnormalised) weight, e.g. 0.35
 *   - appliedWeight            — re-normalised weight actually used in the
 *                                composite (e.g. 0.35/0.80 = 0.4375 when

 *                                is excluded.
 *   - contribution             — `value * appliedWeight` (the row's actual
 *                                share of the 0–100 composite), or `null`
 *                                when excluded.
 *
 * Plus run-level totals:
 *   - weightSum                — sum of default weights for measured axes
 *                                (e.g. 0.80 when rank is null)

 *                                what `computeUVI()` returns.
